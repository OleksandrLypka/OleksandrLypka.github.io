        <h1>Stunt City Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
        <a class="cross-link" href="https://oleksandrlypka.github.io/PrivacyPolicySC.html">Read "Privacy Policy" for Stunt City</a>

        <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the Stunt City app ("Service") provided by <strong>Oleksandr Lypka</strong> (hereinafter referred to as <strong>"We"</strong>, <strong>"Us"</strong>, or <strong>"Our"</strong>).</p>

        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You`re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You`re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn`t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Us.</p>

        <p>We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you`re paying for.</p>

        <p>The Stunt City app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It`s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone`s security features and it could mean that the Stunt City app won`t work properly or at all.</p>

        <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Safety Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>The Service involves simulated vehicle crashes and stunts intended for entertainment purposes only. We strongly discourage attempting any maneuvers, stunts, or reckless driving depicted in the game in real life. Always wear a seatbelt and obey traffic laws.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Responsibility</h3>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don`t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don`t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

        <p>If you`re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you`re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.</p>

        <p>Along the same lines, we cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you can`t turn it on to avail the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.</p>

        <h3>Virtual Goods and Currency</h3>
        <p>The Service may include virtual coins, points, or items ("Virtual Goods"). You acknowledge that Virtual Goods are not real currency, have no monetary value, and cannot be redeemed for real money or tangible goods. You acquire a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use Virtual Goods within the App. All purchases of Virtual Goods are final and non-refundable, except as required by applicable law. We reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Goods at any time.</p>

        <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>The Service may offer auto-renewable subscriptions. If you purchase a subscription, your account will be charged upon confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the then-current subscription rate. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings (Google Play Store or App Store) after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription, where applicable.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h3>
        <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
